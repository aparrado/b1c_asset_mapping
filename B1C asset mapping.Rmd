## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for the B1C Asset Mapping Project. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This project makes extensive use of the programming language R <https://www.r-project.org/> as well as some specialized libraries like Leaflet <https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/> and Shiny <http://www.shinyapps.io/>. It is recommended that whoever modifies this code gains some familiarity with these different software packages before proceeding.

The following steps reproduce bit by bit the map that appears on the B1C website. Before starting, make sure that the directory folder contains the following files:

**Write files here**


The first thing we need to do is to load all the relevant libraries that will be used in the project.
```{r libraries}

library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
```



Then, we are going to load and use the B1C data on the different community resources to create bits of html code that will be subsequently used in our mapping. 

```{r html info}
#Loading data
testdata <- read.csv("test_data.csv")

#Making data into HTML
for (i in 1:nrow(testdata)) {
  testdata$html[i] <- paste(sep = "",
                            "<b><a href='",testdata$Website[i],"' target='_blank'>",
                            testdata$Name[i],"</a></b><br/>",
                            testdata$Address.Line.1[i], "<br/>",
                            testdata$Address.Line.2[i],"<br/>","Phone: ",
                            testdata$Phone[i])
}
```

** Talk about the next step


```{r assigning icons}
#Creating an iconset that has an icon for each category.
iconSet <- iconList(
  Housing = makeIcon("housing.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Employment = makeIcon("employment.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Financial = makeIcon("financial.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Abuse = makeIcon("abuse.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Food = makeIcon("food.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Children = makeIcon("children.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26),
  Education = makeIcon("education.png",iconWidth = 26, iconHeight = 26)
  )

```


**creating shapnes
```{r shapes}
stamford <- geojsonio::geojson_read("stamford.geojson", what = "sp")
stamford$customers<-as.numeric(stamford$customers)
```

**Bins of color
```{r color}
bins <- c(0,2,4,6,8,Inf)
pal <- colorBin("Blues", domain = stamford$customers, bins = bins)
```

** Creating icons
```{r}
#Creating variables for icons
for (i in 1:nrow(testdata)){
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Employment"){
    testdata$group[i] = "Employment/ Training/ Business Development"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Financial"){
    testdata$group[i] = "Financial Assistance and Material Aid"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Abuse"){
    testdata$group[i] = "Abuse/ Domestic Violence/ Sexual Assault"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Food" ){
    testdata$group[i] = "Food Programs"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Children" ){
    testdata$group[i] = "Children and Family Services"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Education" ){
    testdata$group[i] = "Education and Literary Services"
  }
  
  if (testdata$Type[i] == "Housing" ){
    testdata$group[i] = "Housing"
  }
  
}

```


**First version of map
```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
m
```

**Next part
```{r}
m <- m %>% addMarkers(data=testdata, ~Longitude, ~Latitude,icon = ~iconSet[Type], popup = ~html,group=~group)
m
```

**another map but with polygons
```{r}
m <- m %>%  addPolygons(data = stamford, weight=3, opacity = 1, fillOpacity = 0.35, dashArray = "", group = "Show/Hide B1C Clients",
                  color= ~pal(customers),fillColor = ~pal(customers),
                  highlight = highlightOptions(
                    weight = 5,
                    dashArray = "",
                    fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    bringToFront = TRUE))
m
```

** Add labels
```{r}
m <- m %>% addLegend(data=stamford,pal=pal, values=~customers,opacity=0.7,title="Number of B1C Clients",position="bottomright",group="Show/Hide B1C Clients")
m
```


** Add effects to the map
```{r}
m <- m %>%   addLayersControl(
      overlayGroups = c("Employment/ Training/ Business Development","Financial Assistance and Material Aid",
                        "Abuse/ Domestic Violence/ Sexual Assault", "Food Programs","Children and Family Services",
                        "Education and Literary Services","Housing","Show/Hide B1C Clients"),
      position = c("topleft"),
      options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE,opacity = 1))
m
```
